## Personalize

Feel free to use it as-is or customize it as much as you want.
- EDIT CONTENT: Change `src/yourdata.js` to edit your personal portfolio. 
- ADD/REMOVE WHOLE SECTIONS: in the `src/pages/index.js` file.
- UPDATE SEO: Metadata and favicon is configured in the `gatsby-config.js` file.

## Deployment

When you are done with the setup, I recommend deploying to Gatsby Cloud.

You can host directly with Gatsby Cloud by linking your own repository. Every time you push to the main branch of the repo, your changes will be automatically deployed.

For more information, read [Deploying to Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/).
